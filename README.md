# onchain_buildathon24

Our platform creates an ecosystem where filmmakers, curators, and audiences collaborate around impactful stories. Onchain Points and Proof of Watch credentials reward engagement, providing tangible measures of participation and exclusive opportunities for content and experiences. Additionally, our Drop and Gift feature leverages onchain data to foster stronger relationships between filmmakers, curators, and their audiences. This holistic approach not only solves the pressing issues in the entertainment industry but also creates a vibrant, engaged community where every member's contribution is valued and recognized.

## Introduction
